I dont know what I want
So dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road
Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one who feels the way I do
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery
Oh yeah but thats okay
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Oh Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl
Oh oh
Oh Im just a girl
Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said Forever and always yeah
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered Have we met
Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you

Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but
Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared and youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
Hold on to the memories
They will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories
They will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories
They will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please dont ever become a stranger

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now honey but I want em all
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
Darling youre my my my my
Lover
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure
Never have I ever before
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin I could write my name on it
Will you call when youre back at school
I remember thinkin I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin for the better
Wanting was enough
For me it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case youd call
And say you meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying Us
Cause you werent mine to lose
You werent mine to lose no
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Cause you were never mine never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all for the hope of it all
I sit and watch you reading with your
Head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your
Eyes closed
I sit and watch you
And notice everything you do or dont do
Youre so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle heros welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen
I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
Youre so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds where was I
Wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple my mural my sky
Now Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume Im fine
But what would you do if I I
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me I could do it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people Ive ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time
Its me hi Im the problem its me
At tea time everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time
Its me hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At tea time everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from
Its me hi Im the problem its me
Its me hi Im the problem its me
Its me hi everybody agrees everybody agrees
Its me hi hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At tea tea time time everybody agrees everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti hero
The whos who of Whos that is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You dont get to tell me about sad
 If you wanted me dead you shouldve just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive
 So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
Whos afraid of little old me
You should be
 The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs keep your good name
You dont get to tell me you feel bad
 Is it a wonder I broke Lets hear one more joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry
 So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
Whos afraid of little old me
I was tame I was gentle till the circus life made me mean
Dont you worry folks we took out all her teeth
Whos afraid of little old me
Well you should be
 you should be
You should be you should be
You should be you should be
You should be you should be
You should be
 So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is
Then say they didnt do it to hurt me
But what if they did
 I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldnt last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
Im always drunk on my own tears isnt that what they all said
That Ill sue you if you step on my lawn
That Im fearsome and Im wretched and Im wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And thats why youre still singing along
 So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
Whos afraid of little old me
I was tame I was gentle till the circus life made me mean
Dont you worry folks we took out all her teeth
Whos afraid of little old me
Well you should be
 you should be
You should be you should be
Cause you lured me you should be
And you hurt me you should be
And you taught me
 You caged me and then you called me crazy
I am what I am cause you trained me
So whos afraid of me
Whos afraid of little old me
Whos afraid of little old me
